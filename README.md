# ESAASBOOK

## Welcome to the ESAASBOOK repo!
- ESAASBOOK is a Ruby on Rails app ported from the HTML generated by Sphinxbook RSTs.  
- We use [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for authentication.  
- We use the [Recogito.js](https://github.com/recogito/recogito-js) library for highlights/annotations.  


## Setting up the repo

1. Ensure you have the following installed and selected for use:
- Ruby 2.6.6
    - To check your Ruby version you can type `ruby -v` (or `rvm list` if using rvm).
- Rails 6.1.4.6  
    - To check your Rails version you can type `rails -v`


2. Clone the repo and set up your Heroku application


3. Run `bundle install --without production` to install gems


4. Construct the database
    - Run `rails db:migrate` to construct the database
    - Run `heroku rake db:migrate` to migrate on Heroku


5. Seed the database
    - Run `rails db:seed` to populate the DB with necessary seed ddata  
    - Run `heroku rake db:seed` to seed Heroku  


6. Register a github OAuth app
    1.  See [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
        - For deployment on your local machine, use `http://localhost:3000` as your homepage URL and `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/github/callback` as your callback URL
        - For deployment on Heroku use `https://*your heroku app name*.herokuapp.com/` for the homepage and `https://esaas169l.herokuapp.com/users/auth/github/callback` for the callback
    2. Generate a client secret
    3. Make note of your app ID and your client secret


7. Set your Environment variables using Figaro (local) or via Config Vars (Heroku)
    - For local dev: 
        - Run `bundle exec figaro install` to generate Figaro's config file
        - Open your `.gitignore` file and verify that `config/application.yml` is present. Never upload secrets to github!
        - Add the following two lines to your `config/application.yml` file:  
        ```
            GITHUB_APP_ID: (the app id from github)  
            GITHUB_APP_SECRET: (the client secret from github)
        ```
    - For Heroku:
        - Go to your heroku app's dashboard (i.e. `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/*your app name*`)
        - Click `Settings`
        - Click `Reveal Config Vars`
        - Add config vars for `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_SECRET` and provide them the values you got from Github


8. You're good to go!

## Advice
Words of advice for the next generation:

- Add ESLint or other Javascript linter.
- Write more robust javascript tests
- Write a script to automatically extract the book content from the RSTs. At the moment, we are just extracting everything between the `<main></main>` tags. 
- Many items are **manually defined or inserted**:
    - **Images are manually inserted**, they were not generated by the RSTs that the customer provided! Work with the customer to make them get the images working with the RSTs. 
    - Page titles **are manually defined** in the database seeds. If the titles are changed at a higher level you will need to modify the seeds!
        - On the topic of page titles, right now they are all **implemented as fixtures for testing purposes**. Just be aware of this and be prepared to change it to a safer method (proper stubbing)
    - The table of contents was extracted from the RSTs, but then heavily modified to fit the layout that we are using (`/chapter/*number*/section/*number*`)
