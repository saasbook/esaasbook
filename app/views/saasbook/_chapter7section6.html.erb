<h1><span class="section-number">7.6. </span>Cucumber: From User Stories to Acceptance Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#cucumber-from-user-stories-to-acceptance-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Remarkably enough, the tool <strong>Cucumber</strong> turns customer-understandable user stories into <strong>acceptance tests</strong>, which
ensure the customer is satisfied, and <strong>integration tests</strong>, which ensure that the interfaces between modules have
consistent assumptions and communicate correctly. (Chapter 1 describes types of testing.) The key is that Cucumber
meets halfway between the customer and the developer: user stories don’t look like code, so they are clear to the
customer and can be used to reach agreement, but they also aren’t completely freeform. This section explains how
Cucumber accomplishes this minor miracle.</p>
<p>In the Cucumber context we will use the term <strong>user story</strong> to refer to a single <strong>feature</strong> with one or more <strong>scenarios</strong>
that show different ways a feature is used. The keywords <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Feature</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Scenario</span></code> identify the respective components.
Each scenario is in turn composed of a sequence of typically 3 to 8 <em>steps</em>. Expanding a user story into a set of
scenarios also helps developers enumerate the various user-visible conditions that will be tested to ensure the
feature works. For example, consider a fictitious e-commerce site that wants developers to implement the feature
<em>Customer can use “guest checkout” to make a purchase without creating an account</em>. This might be broken down into
several scenarios:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Customer can complete a purchase as guest</p></li>
<li><p>Customer cannot do a guest purchase if the order includes a gift</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple guest checkouts associated with same email address group the orders into the same account</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice in particular the third scenario, which might arise from conversation with the customer while discussing the
feature: “Well, what happens if the same email address appears on multiple orders but that user has no account? Should
we associate those orders with the same customer internally?” Indeed, such discussions are vital to fleshing out
ambiguities in the customer’s desired features.</p>

  Figure 7.5: Top (a): A repetitive, non-DRY scenario for checking the alphabetical ordering of movies in the list. Middle (b):
A DRYer, more declarative expression of the same scenario. Bottom (c): Adding this code to movie_steps.rb creates new
step definitions matching lines 5–7 of the declarative scenario by reusing existing steps. (Recall from Figure 2.2 that %Q is an
alternative syntax for double-quoting a string.) We will learn about expect, which appears in line 13, in the next chapter.

<p>Figure 7.4 is an example user story, showing a feature with one scenario of adding the movie <em>Hamilton</em>; the scenario has
nine steps. (We show just a single scenario in this example, but features usually have many scenarios.) Although stilted
writing, this format that Cucumber can act upon is still easy for the nontechnical customer to understand, providing a
common representation of the story on which the customer and team can now collaborate — a founding principle of Agile and BDD.</p>
<p>Each step of a scenario starts with its own keyword. Steps that start with <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Given</span></code> usually set up some preconditions, such
as navigating to a page. Steps that start with <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">When</span></code> typically use one of Cucumber’s built-in web steps to simulate the user
pressing a button, for example. Steps that start with <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Then</span></code> will usually check to see if some condition is true. The
conjunction <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">And</span></code> allows more complicated versions of <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Given</span></code>, <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">When</span></code>, or <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Then</span></code> phrases. The only other keyword you see in this
format is <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">But</span></code>.</p>
<p>A separate set of files defines the Ruby code that tests these steps. These are called
<em>step definitions</em>. How does Cucumber match each step of a scenario with the correct step
definitions? The trick is that Cucumber uses regular expressions or <strong>regexes</strong> (Chapter 2) to
match the phrases in the scenario steps to the step definitions themselves. For example, below
is a string from a step definition in the scenario for RottenPotatoes:</p>
<div class="highlight-cucumber notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Given </span><span class="nf">/^(?:|I )am on (.+)$/</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This regex can match the text “I am on the RottenPotatoes home page” on line 6 of Figure 7.4. The regex also
captures the string after the phrase “am on ” until the end of the line (“the RottenPotatoes home page”). The
body of the step definition contains Ruby code that tests the step, likely using captured strings such as the
one above. Thus, most step definitions are typically used by many different steps. You can think of step definitions
as method definitions, and the steps of the scenarios are analogous to method calls.</p>
<p>We then need a tool that will act as a user and pretend to use the feature under different scenarios. In the Rails
world, this tool is called <em>Capybara</em>, and Cucumber integrates seamlessly with it. Capybara “pretends to be a user”
by taking actions in a simulated web browser, for example, clicking on a link or button. Capybara can interact with
the app to receive pages, parse the HTML, and submit forms as a user would. In the rest of this chapter and its
associated CHIPS, you will write your own steps to describe the app’s behavior, then connect the steps to step
definitions that actually stimulate the app to instantiate the behaviors—the core of Behavior-Driven Design.</p>
<p>Finally, the simple scenario above only describes one particular <strong>happy path</strong> of the feature in question, but it
is also important to agree with the customer on what should happen when things go wrong. For example, if the user
leaves the movie title blank, we would probably want to redisplay the Create New Movie page, but perhaps with an
error message informing the user of what went wrong. This “sad path” would get its own scenario in the feature file
and its own storyboard, since describing what happens when things go wrong is part of the overall feature.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Check 7.6.1.</strong> <em>Given that Cucumber step definitions are just Ruby code, in principle we could just write the entire
scenario in Ruby, rather than writing steps in stilted English and looking up the step definition for each step. Why do
you think Cucumber has remained popular despite this fact?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The customer can (probably) read the Cucumber scenario steps and understand the description of what the app is supposed
to do, and can determine whether they agree with that description. Most customers would find it much more difficult to
read Ruby code. Thus the scenarios provide a common ground on which the technical team and customer can meet.</p>
