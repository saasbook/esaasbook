<h1><span class="section-number">8.12. </span>Concluding Remarks: TDD vs. Conventional Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#concluding-remarks-tdd-vs-conventional-debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we’ve used RSpec to develop a method using TDD with unit tests. Although
TDD may feel strange at first, most people who try it quickly realize that they already
use the unit-testing techniques it calls for, but in a different workflow. Often, a typical
developer will write some code, assume it probably works, test it by running the whole
application, and hit a bug. As an MIT programmer lamented at the first software engineering
conference in 1968: “We build systems like the Wright brothers built airplanes—build the whole
thing, push it off a cliff, let it crash, and start over again.”</p>
<p>Once a bug has been hit, if inspecting the code doesn’t reveal the problem, the typical
developer would next try inserting print statements around the suspect area to print out the
values of relevant variables or indicate which path of a conditional was followed. The TDD
developer would instead write assertions using <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expect</span></code>.</p>
<p>If the bug still can’t be found, the typical developer might isolate part of the code by
carefully setting up conditions to skip over method calls they don’t care about or change
variable values to force the code to go down the suspected buggy path. For example, they
might do this by setting a breakpoint using a debugger and manually inspecting or manipulating
variable values before continuing past the breakpoint. In contrast, the TDD developer would
isolate the suspect code path using stubs and mocks to control what happens when certain
methods are called and which direction conditionals will go.</p>
<p>By now, the typical developer is absolutely convinced that he’ll certainly find the bug and
won’t have to repeat this tedious manual process, though this usually turns out to be wrong.
The TDD developer has isolated each behavior in its own spec, so repeating the process just
means re-running the spec.</p>
<p>In other words: If we write the code first and have to fix bugs, we end up using the same
techniques required in TDD, but less efficiently and more manually, hence less productively.</p>
<p>But if we use TDD, bugs can be spotted immediately as the code is written. If our code works
the first time, using TDD still gives us a regression test to catch bugs that might creep
into this part of the code in the future.</p>
