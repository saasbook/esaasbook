<p>The goal of exploration is to understand the app from both the customers’ and the developers’
point of view. The specific techniques you use may depend on your immediate aims:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You’re brand new to the project and need to understand the app’s overall architecture, documenting as you go so others don’t have to repeat your discovery process.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to understand just the moving parts that would be affected by a specific change you’ve been asked to make.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re looking for areas that need beautification because you’re in the process of port- ing or otherwise updating a legacy codebase.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just as we explored SaaS architecture in Chapter 3 using height as an analogy, we can follow
some “outside-in” steps to understand the structure of a legacy app at various levels:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Check out a scratch branch to run the app in a development environment</p></li>
<li><p>Learn and replicate the user stories, working with other stakeholders if necessary</p></li>
<li><p>Examine the database schema and the relationships among the most important classes 4. Skim all the code to quantify code quality and test coverage</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since operating on the live app could endanger customer data or the user experience, the
first step is to get the application running in a development or staging environment in
which perturbing its operation causes no inconvenience to users. Create a <em>scratch branch</em>
of the repo that you never intend to check back in and can therefore be used for
experimentation. Create a development database if there isn’t an existing one used for
development. An easy way to do this is to clone the production database if it isn’t too
large, thereby sidestepping numerous pitfalls:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The app may have relationships such as has-many or belongs-to that are reflected in the table rows. Without knowing the details of these relationships, you might create an in- valid subset of data. Using RottenPotatoes as an example, you might inadvertently end up with a <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">review</span></code> whose <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">movie_id</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">moviegoer_id</span></code> refer to nonexistent movies or moviegoers.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloning the database eliminates possible differences in behavior between production and development resulting from differences in database implementations, difference in how certain data types such as dates are represented in different databases, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloning gives you realistic valid data to work with in development.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t clone the production database, or you have successfully cloned it but it’s
too unwieldy to use in development all the time, you can create a development database by
extracting fixture data from the real database5 using the steps in Figure 9.3.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># on production computer:</span>
<span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>production rake db:schema:dump
<span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>production rake db:fixtures:extract
<span class="c1"># copy db/schema.rb and test/fixtures/*.yml to development computer</span>
<span class="c1"># then, on development computer:</span>
rake db:create        <span class="c1"># uses RAILS_ENV=development by default</span>
rake db:schema:load
rake db:fixtures:load
</pre></div>
</div>

  Figure 9.3: You can create an empty development database that has the same schema as the production database and then
populate it with fixtures. Although Chapter 8 cautions against the abuse of fixtures, in this case we are using them to
replicate known behavior from the production environment in your development environment.

<p>Once the app is running in development, have one or two experienced customers demonstrate
how they use the app, indicating during the demo what changes they have in mind (Nierstrasz
et al. 2009). Ask them to talk through the demo as they go; although their comments will
often be in terms of the user experience (“Now I’m adding Mona as an admin user”), if the
app was created using BDD, the comments may reflect examples of the original user stories
and therefore the app’s architecture. Ask frequent questions during the demo, and if the
maintainers of the app are available, have them observe the demo as well. In Section 9.3
we will see how these demos can form the basis of “ground truth” tests to underpin your
changes.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of how the app works, take a look at the database schema; Fred Brooks,
Rob Pike, and others have all acknowledged the importance of understanding the data
structures as a key to understanding the app logic. You can use an interactive database GUI
to explore the schema, but you might find it more efficient to run <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rake</span> <span class="pre">db:schema:dump</span></code>, which
creates a file <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">db/schema.rb</span></code> containing the database schema in the migrations DSL introduced
in Section 4.2. The goal is to match up the schema with the app’s overall architecture.</p>
<p>Figure 9.4 shows a simplified Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram generated by the
<code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">railroady</span></code> gem that captures the relationships among the most important classes and the most
important attributes of those classes. While the diagram may look overwhelming initially,
since not all classes play an equally important structural role, you can identify “highly
connected” classes that are probably central to the application’s functions. For example,
in Figure 9.4, the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Customer</span></code> and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Voucher</span></code> classes are connected to each other and to many other
classes. You can then identify the tables corresponding to these classes in the database schema.</p>

  Figure 9.4: This simplified Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram, produced automatically by the railroady
gem, shows the models in a Rails app that manages ticket sales, donations, and performance attendance for a small theater.
Edges with arrowheads or circles show relationships between classes: a Customer has many Visits and Vouchers (open
circle to arrowhead), has one most_recent_visit (solid circle to arrowhead), and has and belongs to many Labels
(arrowhead to arrowhead). Plain edges show inheritance: Donation and Voucher are subclasses of Item. (All of the
important classes here inherit from ActiveRecord::Base, but railroady draws only the app’s classes.) We will see other
types of UML diagrams in Chapter 11.

<p>Having familiarized yourself with the app’s architecture, most important data structures, and
major classes, you are ready to look at the code. The goal of inspecting the code is to get a
sense of its overall quality, test coverage, and other statistics that serve as a proxy for how
painful it may be to understand and modify. Therefore, before diving into any specific file,
run <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rake</span> <span class="pre">stats</span></code> to get the total number of lines of code and lines of tests for each file; this
information can tell you which classes are most complex and therefore probably most important
(highest LOC), best tested (best code-to-test ratio), simple “helper” classes (low LOC), and
so on, deepening the understanding you bootstrapped from the class diagram and database schema.
(Later in this chapter we’ll show how to evaluate code with some
additional quality metrics to give you a heads up of where the hairiest efforts might be.) If
test suites exist, run them; assuming most tests pass, read the tests to help understand the
original developers’ intentions. Then spend one hour (Nierstrasz et al. 2009) inspecting the
code in the most important classes as well as those you believe you’ll need to modify (the
<em>change points</em>), which by now you should be getting a good sense of.</p>

  Figure 9.5: A 3-by-5 inch (or A7 size) Class–Responsibility–Collaborator (CRC) card representing the Voucher class from
Figure 9.4. The left column represents Voucher’s responsibilities—things it knows (instance variables) or does (instance
methods). Since Ruby instance variables are always accessed through instance methods, we can determine responsibilities
by searching the class file voucher.rb for instance methods and calls to attr_accessor. The right column represents
Voucher’s collaborator classes; for Rails apps we can determine many of these by looking for has_many and belongs_to in
voucher.rb.

<p><strong>Self-Check 9.2.1.</strong> <em>What are some reasons it is important to get the app running in development

<blockquote>
<div><p>A few reasons include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>For SaaS, the existing tests may need access to a test database, which may not be accessible in production.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of your exploration might involve the use of an interactive debugger or other tools that could slow down execution, which would be disruptive on the live site.</p></li>
<li><p>For part of your exploration you might want to modify data in the database, which you can’t do with live customer data.</p></li>
