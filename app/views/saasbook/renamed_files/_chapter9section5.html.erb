<div><p><em>1. Declining Quality - The quality of [software] systems will appear to be declining
unless they are rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes.</em></p>
<p class="attribution">—Lehman’s seventh law of software evolution</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A key theme of this book is that engineering software is about creating not just working
code, but <em>beautiful</em> working code. This chapter should make clear why we believe this:
beautiful code is easier and less expensive to maintain. Given that software can live much
longer than hardware, even engineers whose aesthetic sensibilities aren’t moved by the idea
of beautiful code can appreciate the practical economic advantage of reducing lifetime
maintenance costs.</p>
<p>How can you tell when code is less than beautiful, and how do you improve it? We’ve all seen
examples of code that’s less than beautiful, even if we can’t always pin down the specific
problems. We can identify problems in two ways: quantitatively using <strong>software metrics</strong> and
qualitatively using <strong>code smells</strong>. Both are useful and tell us different things about the
code, and we apply both to the ugly code in Figure 9.6.</p>
<p><strong>Software metrics **are quantitative measurements of code complexity, which is often an estimate
of the difficulty of thoroughly testing a piece of code. Dozens of metrics exist, and opinion
varies widely on their usefulness, effectiveness, and “normal range” of values. Most metrics
are based on the **control flow graph</strong> of the program, in which each graph node represents a
<strong>basic block</strong> (a set of statements that are always executed together), and an edge from node
A to node B means that there is some code path in which B’s basic block is executed immediately
after A’s.</p>
<p>Figure 9.10 shows the control flow graph corresponding to Figure 9.6, which we can use to
compute two widely-used indicators of method-level complexity:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Cyclomatic complexity</strong> measures the number of linearly-independent paths through a piece of code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ABC score</strong> is a weighted sum of the number of <strong>A</strong>ssignments, <strong>B</strong>ranches and <strong>C</strong>onditionals in a piece of code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These analyses are usually performed on source code and were originally developed for
statically-typed languages. In dynamic languages, the analyses are complicated by
metaprogramming and other mechanisms that may cause changes to the control flow graph at
runtime. Nonetheless, they are useful first-order metrics, and as you might expect, the
Ruby community has developed tools to measure them. <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">saikuro</span></code> computes a simplified version
of cyclomatic complexity and <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flog</span></code> computes a variant of the ABC score that is weighted in
a way appropriate for Ruby idioms. Both of these and more are included in the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metric_fu</span></code>
gem (part of the courseware). Running <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rake</span> <span class="pre">metrics</span></code> on a Rails app computes various metrics
including these, and highlights parts of the code in which multiple metrics are outside
their recommended ranges. In addition, CodeClimate provides many of these metrics as a
service: by creating an account there and linking your GitHub repository to it, you can
view a “report card” of your code metrics anytime, and the report is automatically updated
when you push new code to GitHub. Figure 9.11 summarizes useful metrics we’ve seen so far
that speak to testability and therefore to code beauty.</p>
<p>The second way to spot code problems is by looking for <strong>code smells</strong>, which are structural
characteristics of source code not readily captured by metrics. Like real smells, code
smells call our attention to places that may be problematic. Martin Fowler’s classic book
on refactoring (Fowler et al. 1999) lists 22 code smells, four of which we show in
Figure 9.12, and Robert C. Martin’s <em>Clean Code</em> (Martin 2008) has one of the more comprehensive
catalogs with an amazing 63 code smells, of which three are specific to Java, nine are about
testing, and the remainder are more general.</p>
<p>Four particular smells that appear in Martin’s <em>Clean Code</em> are worth emphasizing, because they
are symptoms of other problems that you can often fix by simple refactorings. These four are
identified by the acronym <strong>SOFA</strong>, which states that a well-written method should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>be <strong>S</strong>hort, so that its main purpose is quickly grasped;</p></li>
<li><p>do only <strong>O</strong>ne thing, so testing can focus on thoroughly exercising that one thing;</p></li>
<li><p>take <strong>F</strong>ew arguments, so that all-important combinations of argument values can be tested;</p></li>
<li><p>maintain a consistent level of <strong>A</strong>bstraction, so that it doesn’t jump back and forth between saying <em>what to do</em> and saying <em>how to do it</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 9.6 violates at least the first and last of these, and exhibits other smells as
well, as we can see by running reek on it:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>time_setter.rb -- <span class="m">5</span> warnings:
    TimeSetter#self.convert calls <span class="o">(</span>y + <span class="m">1</span><span class="o">)</span> twice <span class="o">(</span>Duplication<span class="o">)</span>
    TimeSetter#self.convert has approx <span class="m">6</span> statements <span class="o">(</span>LongMethod<span class="o">)</span>
    TimeSetter#self.convert has the parameter name <span class="s1">&#39;d&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span>UncommunicativeName<span class="o">)</span>
    TimeSetter#self.convert has the variable name <span class="s1">&#39;d&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span>UncommunicativeName<span class="o">)</span>
    TimeSetter#self.convert has the variable name <span class="s1">&#39;y&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span>UncommunicativeName<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Not DRY</strong> (line 2). Admittedly this is only a minor duplication, but as with any smell,
it’s worth asking ourselves why the code turned out that way.</p>
<p><strong>Uncommunicative names</strong> (lines 4–6). Variable y appears to be an integer (lines 6, 7, 10, 14)
and is related to another variable <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code> —what could those be? For that matter, what does the
class <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TimeSetter</span></code> set the time to, and what is being converted to what in <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">convert</span></code>? Four
decades ago, memory was precious and so variable names were kept short to allow more space
for code. Today, there’s no excuse for poor variable names; Figure 9.13 provides suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Too long</strong> (line 3). More lines of code per method means more places for bugs to hide, more
paths to test, and more mocking and stubbing during testing. However, excessive length is
really a symptom that emerges from more specific problems—in this case, failure to stick
to a single level of <strong>A</strong>bstraction. As Figure 9.14 shows, <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">convert</span></code> really consists of a small
number of high-level steps, each of which could be divided into sub-steps. But in the code,
there is no way to tell where the boundaries of steps or sub-steps would be, making the method
harder to understand. Indeed, the nested conditional in lines 6–8 makes it hard for a programmer
to mentally “walk through” the code, and complicates testing since you have to select sets of
test cases that exercise each possible code path.</p>
<div class="highlight-ruby notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">with</span> <span class="no">Year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1980</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">Year</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">leap</span> <span class="n">year</span>
        <span class="k">then</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">possible</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">peel</span> <span class="n">off</span> <span class="mi">366</span> <span class="n">days</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">advance</span> <span class="no">Year</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="n">peel</span> <span class="n">off</span> <span class="mi">365</span> <span class="n">days</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">advance</span> <span class="no">Year</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">return</span> <span class="no">Year</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As a result of these deficiencies, you probably had to work hard to figure out what
this relatively simple method does. (You might blame this on a lack of comments in the
code, but once the above smells are fixed, there will be hardly any need for them.) Astute
readers usually note the constants 1980, 365, and 366, and infer that the method has
something to do with leap years and that 1980 is special. In fact, convert calculates
the current year given a starting year of 1980 and the number of days elapsed since January
1 of that year, as Figure 9.14 shows using simple pseudocode. In Section 9.5, we will make
the Ruby code as transparent as the pseudocode by <strong>refactoring</strong> it—applying transformations
that improve its structure without changing its behavior.</p>
<p>A few specific examples of doing one thing are worth calling out because they occur frequently:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Handling an exception is one thing. If method <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> computes something and also tries to handle various exceptions that could arise while doing so, consider splitting out a method <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M'\)</span> that just does the work, and having <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> do exception handling and otherwise delegate the work to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M'\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Queries (computing something) and commands (doing something that causes a side effect) are distinct, so a method should either compute something that is side-effect- free or it should cause a specific side effect, but not both. Such violations of <em>command–query separation</em> also complicate testing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self-Check 9.5.1.</strong> <em>Give an example of a dynamic language feature in Ruby that could distort
metrics such as cyclomatic complexity or ABC score.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Any metaprogramming mechanism could do this. A trivial example is <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s=&quot;if</span> <span class="pre">(d&gt;=366)[...]&quot;;</span> <span class="pre">eval</span> <span class="pre">s,</span></code>
since the evaluation of the string would cause a conditional to be executed even though there’s
no conditional in the code itself, which contains only an assignment to a variable and a call
to the <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval</span></code> method. A subtler example is a method such as <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">before_filter</span></code> (Section 5.1), which
essentially adds a new method to a list of methods to be called before a controller action.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Self-Check 9.5.2.</strong> <em>Which SOFA guideline—be</em> <strong>S</strong><em>hort, do</em> <strong>O</strong><em>ne thing, have</em> <strong>F</strong><em>ew arguments, stick
to a single level of</em> <strong>A</strong><em>bstraction—do you think is most important from a unit-testability
point of view?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>F</strong>ew arguments implies fewer ways that code paths in the method can depend on the arguments,
making testing more tractable. <strong>S</strong>hort methods are certainly easier to test, but this property
usually follows when the other three are observed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
